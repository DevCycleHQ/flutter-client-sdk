Android and/or iOS.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,

Build instructions

## Prerequisites

See the [Flutter install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) page for setting up Flutter for building Android and iOS plugins.

## Testing

To run the unit tests for the SDK, run `flutter test` in the SDK repo.
